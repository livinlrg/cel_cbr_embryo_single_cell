<h4>TPM vs. TPM plot:</h4>
<p>The transcripts per million (TPM), which is a summary expression value, is plotted here for the orthologs from <i>C. elegans</i> and <i>C. briggsae</i>. As more genes are selected, a matrix of plots is formed that show expression comparisons between orthologs.</p>
<br>
<h4>TPM vs. percent in plot:</h4>
<p>The transcripts per million (TPM) for each gene individually is plotted against the percent of cells that express that gene. The percent in statistic should be viewed with a bit of caution for comparisons between genes, as how deeply a sequencing library is sequenced can bias the observed % in values.</p>
<br>
<h4>Expression bar plot:</h4>
<p>The expression across the terminal cell types or progenitors is shown for each gene individually as transcripts per million (TPM). The cell types are grouped by their major cell class or lineage origin. Using a linear plotting scale, it is straightforward to see large expression differences.</p>
<br>
<h4>Circular lineage plot:</h4>
<p>Within the progenitor tab, you can see the expression of your genes across the development lineage, starting at the 16-cell stage. Here, gene expression is shown as a color scale using the transcripts per million (TPM). The circle follows the Sulston lineage, with the anterior and posterior divisions shown as left and right daughters, respectively.</p>
<br>
<h4>Orthology:</h4>
<p>Upon doing an ortholog search, the app will see if your gene is in an orthogroup. An orthogroup is a collection of orthologous genes. Here, we determined orthologs using OrthoFinder2. If your gene is in one of the identified orthogroups, it will be displayed here with every gene from <i>C. elegans</i> and <i>C. briggsae</i>. Also, it will show whether any of the genes from the two species were classified as being 1:1 orthologs for the purposes of comparison between species. Summary statistics on these determinations are shown below, including our confidence in the call, whether the genes are syntenic, are each others mutual best match by BLAT score search, whether they were each others mutual best match by Smith-Waterman alignment score, and some details on those alignments.</p>

<h4>Cell type selector:</h4>
<p>At top, you will see a selector for the cell class (tissue) and the cell type if you wish to select a different cell to investigate. Below is a panel that shows your cell type selection, and all of the lineages we have associated with this cell type name. Additionally, if the cell type is a terminal cell type, we display additional naming conventions for the cell type (e.g. AMshL and AMshR for AMsh).</p>
<br>
<h4>Cell type page:</h4>
<p>The cell type page snapshot gives summary details about your cell type including the types of genes specifically expressed there, what these genes are, and how similar the cell type is between species. The top left panel shows every 1:1 ortholog and their expression in Transcripts per Million (TPM) from either species, and colored with whether we identified that gene as having specific expression in your cell type (a cell type marker).</p>
<p>In the top right panel, the WormCat tier 1 annotations are displayed for all of the <i>C. elegans</i> markers as both their total count, and their fold-enrichment.</p>
<p>In the middle panel, the identity of markers that are shared between species (black), are only identified in <i>C. elegans</i> (green), or in <i>C. briggsae</i> (blue) are shown, with their expression in both species.</p>
<p>In the bottom set of panels, there are distributions showing various different summary metrics for the full set of cell types in green for <i>C. elegans</i> and blue for <i>C. briggsae</i>. Your chosen cell type is shown as a vertical line in the two colors for the two species, or as a red vertical line for the pairwise comparisons, with a 95% confidence interval around the point estimate. From these distributions you can access how your cell type compares to other in the dataset, how well it was captured in these experiments, and some biological features about the cell type:</p>
<p><b>Cell count:</b> Total number of cells captured and annotated with that cell type identity.</p>
<p><b>Genes detect:</b> Using bootstrapping when calculating the TPM values, we create a 95% confidence interval around our expression value estimate. If the lower confidence interval intersects zero, we consider this gene not confidently detected. Here we show the number of genes detected for every cell type.</p>
<p><b>Marker count:</b> The number of markers identified in each cell type in each species.</p>
<p><b>Ratio of non-1:1 markers:</b> The ratio of the number of markers that have a 1:1 ortholog to no 1:1 ortholog in the other species.</p>
<p><b>Gini coefficient:</b> A statistic to measure inequality, the gini coefficient shows how balanced (0) or unbalanced (1) a transcriptome is. A value of zero means every gene is expressed equally, which a value of one means just one gene is expressed.</p>
<p><b>Mean number of UMI:</b> The mean number of UMI that were detected in each cell of that cell type.</p>
<p><b>Jensen-Shannon distance:</b> A metric that compares the distance between two probability distributions. Here, we use the two species cell type expression distributions for all 1:1 orthologs to calculate the Jensen-Shannon distance. Please refer to the paper for more details.</p>
<p><b>Pearson correlation:</b> The Pearson correlation between the two species cell type transcriptomes.</p>
<p><b>Cosine distance:</b> The cosine distance is another distance metric that is one minus the cosine angle.</p>
<p><b>Between species Differentially Expressed Genes:</b> The number of genes that were determined to be differentially expressed by a Wilcoxon test. A full list of these genes is found on the GitHub page.</p>
<p>The data presented in this cell page summary is also available with the discrete values in the Cell table tab under Tables.</p>
<br>
<h4>Cell type markers:</h4>
<p>If youâ€™re interested in which genes are specifically expressed in your cell type (cell type markers), the Cell type markers tab will give a visual summary of the top hits.</p>
<p>After selecting your cell, you can adjust the total number of top markers in the two species that are displayed. As discussed in the paper, markers are calculated in each species individually using a Wilcoxon test and filtered by the adjusted p-value, log2FC, and expression level (>80 TPM in that cell type). You can adjust by which metric the top markers are sorted by. We default to a combination of specificity (log2fc) and expression level (TPM). On the x-axis, the measure of specificity is displayed (log2fc), which is the log2 fold-change in expression of your cell type versus the rest of the dataset. So for example, for hyp7_C_lineage, the TPM value of the gene in that cell is compared to the TPM of that gene in the rest of the dataset. The different markers are then grouped by their WormCat tier 1 gene function categorization. You can also look at all of the markers in table form through the Marker table in the Table tab.</p>

    <li>Discover the orthology relationship of your gene</li>
    <li>Determine which cell types your gene is expressed in</li>
    <li>Find out whether your gene has a conserved expression pattern between species</li>
  </ul>

<p>First, search for your gene by clearing the content under Search Gene, typing your gene name, and select Orthology under the Gene Sub-Tab. You can search for the common name, the cosmid name, or the WBGene name. Knowing whether your gene was duplicated in <i>C. elegans</i> or <i>C. briggsae</i> will help provide context to any changes in gene expression observed between the species.</p>

<p>On the orthology page, if you searched your gene, you will see the â€˜Orthogroupâ€™ which contains your gene, its predicted orthology status based on our analyses, and a maximum-likelihood tree of genes in the orthogroup from the elegans supergroup. Any orthology relationship called here (1:1 versus not 1:1) should be viewed as a hypothesis about its evolutionary history. For the purposes of comparing more evolutionary related orthologs, genes that are duplicated in one species, but show evidence of being at the ancestral location and have higher protein sequence conservation were classified as 1:1 genes.</p>

<div style='text-align: center;'>
<img src='orthology_plot_screenshot.png' width='500px'>
</div>

<p>After determining the orthology status of your gene, letâ€™s now look at what cell types your gene and its orthologs are expressed in. In either the Main tab or the Genes tab, search for your gene in the ortholog search.</p>

<p>You can choose to either look in the terminal cell types or the progenitors for your geneâ€™s expression. Letâ€™s start with the terminal gene expression pattern. On the first tab, if your gene has an ortholog in the reciprocal species, you will see the comparison of your geneâ€™s expression pattern in terminal cell types between <i>C. elegans</i> and <i>C. briggsae</i>. Multiple genes from either species can be plotted here depending on the size of your geneâ€™s orthogroup (see <i>ugt-49</i> as an example below). Below we see intestinal expression of <i>ugt-49</i> in both species.</p>

<div style='text-align: center;'>
<img src='tpm_tpm_plot_screenshot.png' width='500px'>
</div>

<p>On the next tab, you will see the TPM vs. percentage of cells expressing this gene as seen on the WormBase gene pages. Please note that these kinds of plots provide a skewed representation of a geneâ€™s expression patterns as the percentage of cells expressing will vary based on how deeply the single-cell sequencing libraries were sequenced. For our case, the C. briggsae libraries were sequenced less deeply, meaning they will systematically show a lower cell percent expressing.</p>

<p>Next, the expression is shown as a bar plot for easy comparison of expression pattern differences between species and orthologs. You might have to scroll to the right to see the full plots. Below is a clear case of expression difference for the gene <i>ceh-53</i>, which has a remarkable difference in expression in the ASG ciliated neuron.</p>

<div style='text-align: center;'>
<img src='bar_plot_screenshot.png' width='500px'>
</div>

<p>Under the progenitors tab, you will additionally see a Circular lineage plot, which displays the shared invariant lineage, with your geneâ€™s expression overlaid. From this view, it is easiest to see whether a change in expression in a particular development has occurred between species. For example, in the below circle plots for <i>aptf-2</i>, <i>Cbr-aptf-2.1</i> and <i>Cbr-aptf-2.2</i>, we can see an expression difference in the MSxap lineages for <i>Cbr-aptf-2.2</i> relative to <i>aptf-2</i>.</p>

<div style='text-align: center;'>
<img src='circle_plot_screenshot.png' width='500px'>
</div>

<p>For all of these visualizations, the plotting scale (log2 or lineage based) or whether the plots shared a scale (individual or shared) can be altered in the navigation panel to the left. For some visualizations, one style of plotting may be advantageous to see clear differences.</p>

<p>Finally, you can dive deeper into a bunch of summary statistics for all of the genes classified as 1:1 orthologs within the Gene table under the Tables tab.</p>

Additionally, if the cell type is a terminal cell type, we display additional naming conventions for the cell type (e.g. AMshL and AMshR for AMsh).</p>

<p>Finally, the cell type page snapshot gives summary details about your cell type including the types of genes specifically expressed there, what these genes are, and how similar the cell type is between species.
The top left panel shows every 1:1 ortholog and their expression in Transcripts per Million (TPM) from either species, and colored with whether we identified that gene as having specific expression in your cell type (a cell type marker). Compared to other cell types, it appears that hyp4_hyp5_hyp6 has several genes with high expression (>30,000 TPM) that are shared between species.</p>

<p>In the top right panel, the WormCat tier 1 annotations are displayed for all of the <i>C. elegans</i> markers as both their total count, and their fold-enrichment. For our below example of hyp4_hyp5_hyp6, we can see genes associated with the terms Extracellular Matrix and Lysosome enriched in this cell type.</p>

<p>In the middle panel, the identity of markers that are shared between species (black), are only identified in <i>C. elegans</i> (green), or in <i>C. briggsae</i> (blue) are shown, with their expression in both species.</p>

<p>In the bottom set of panels, there are distributions showing various different summary metrics for the full set of cell types in green for <i>C. elegans</i> and blue for <i>C. briggsae</i>.
